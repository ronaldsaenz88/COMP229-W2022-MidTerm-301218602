## Mid-Term Test 

MidTerm Project - the Favourite Book List App

Due: March 7, 2022

Project Setup:

- Rename the Web App Template provided to COMP229-W2022-MidTerm-[YourStudentID]. (e.g. COMP229-W2022-MidTerm-300929668).
- You will need to create a new Mongo Database on MongoDB Atlas. You will need to change the URI variable in the db config file (config/db.js) to point MongoDB Atlas.
- You will need to add some example Book data in the database. 

Overview: Using your knowledge of NodeJS and ExpressJS and the Web App Template provided,
complete the Favourite Book List web app that you will share on GitHub and deploy to Heroku (or
another cloud provider). Your web app already includes basic navigation controls, a Landing Page, a
BookList page and a BookDetails page. Your task is to complete the code that is missing from the
routing files and the Books List page so that a user can Add, Delete and Edit any Book item from the
Database

Instructions:

1. The BooksList page (views/books/index.ejs) already lists your favourite books. Your job is
to fix the Add Button, and insert the appropriate code for the Edit and Delete Buttons.

2. The Books Routing File (routes/books.js) already has a route working to find all the books in
the books collection and render your BooksList page. Your task for this section is to complete
the logic for each of the other routes to render the book details page when the Add or Edit
Buttons are clicked, process a request to Add or Edit a Book, and process a request to Delete a
book.
